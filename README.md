# GURPS Character Creator

An interactive sheet for creating and storing a character for the tabletop role-playing game system [GURPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS). This was my very first coding project back in 2015 when learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The sheet supports character creation for the point-based system by automatically calculating and inserting values for basic stats as well as advantages, disadvantages, perks, quirks and skills.
